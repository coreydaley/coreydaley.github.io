As AI tools continue to proliferate across the development landscape, I've found myself in an interesting position: rather than settling on a single "best" AI assistant, I'm discovering that each tool excels in its own domain. Here's how different AI tools are finding their natural niches in my daily workflow.

## The Command Line Trio: Codex, Claude Code, and Copilot CLI

For site design and coding tasks ranging from simple to complex, I rely on a powerful trio of CLI tools:

- **Codex** for quick code generation and exploration
- **Claude Code** for more complex, multi-file refactorings and architectural decisions
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** for command-line assistance and shell scripting

What makes these tools particularly effective is their tight integration with my terminal workflow. They're context-aware, fast, and don't require switching away from my development environment.

## ChatGPT (Web): The Visual Creative

While ChatGPT Desktop has become a powerful tool for many tasks, I've found myself gravitating toward the **web version for one specific reason: image creation**. Interestingly, this functionality seems to be missing (or at least less accessible) in ChatGPT Desktop, making the web interface my go-to for visual content generation.

Whether I need mockups, diagrams, or conceptual illustrations for blog posts, the web version of ChatGPT remains unmatched in my toolkit.

## GitHub Copilot in VSCode: The Code Completion Specialist

Inside Visual Studio Code, **GitHub Copilot** has become my primary code completion engine. Its suggestions are contextually aware, fast, and increasingly accurate. Rather than trying to use it for everything, I've learned to trust it most for:

- Auto-completing repetitive code patterns
- Suggesting idiomatic implementations
- Quickly scaffolding boilerplate code

It's not trying to be my pair programmer - it's trying to be my best autocomplete, and it excels at that role.

## Claude Code/Desktop: The Content Creator

For writing blog posts and longer-form content, I've settled on **Claude Code and Claude Desktop**, primarily because of their **Notion integration**. The ability to:

1. Maintain a to-do list of blog post ideas in Notion
2. Have Claude read from that list
3. Generate complete, well-structured blog posts
4. Push the content back to my Hugo site

...has transformed my content creation workflow. It's not just about generating text - it's about having an AI that understands my content management system and can work within it seamlessly.

## The Unexplored Territory: AI as a Peer

There's one area where I'm still finding my footing: **using AI as a true Software Engineering peer**. The idea of bouncing architectural ideas off an AI, discussing trade-offs, and exploring different implementation approaches is incredibly appealing, but I haven't fully integrated it into my workflow yet.

Part of the challenge is learning to ask the right questions. I'm particularly interested in exploring **planning mode** more deeply - the ability to have AI help think through solutions before diving into implementation.

## Key Takeaway: Specialization Over Consolidation

The interesting lesson from this multi-AI workflow isn't that one tool rules them all. Instead, it's that **each AI tool has found its specialized niche**:

- CLI tools for development
- Web-based ChatGPT for visuals
- Copilot for code completion
- Claude for content creation

Rather than fighting this fragmentation, I'm embracing it. Each tool does what it does best, and my workflow is stronger for it.

## What's Next?

As I continue to refine this workflow, I'm excited to explore:

1. **Deeper integration of planning mode** for architectural decisions
2. **Better collaboration patterns** between different AI tools
3. **More sophisticated prompt engineering** to maximize each tool's strengths

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and I suspect my workflow will continue to adapt. But for now, I'm finding real value in letting each AI assistant play to its strengths rather than forcing any single tool to do everything.
