Hey there, and welcome! I'm excited to finally have my own corner of the internet up and running. This is the first real post on my new blog, and I wanted to kick things off by talking a little about how I built it.

## Why Hugo?

When I decided to start a blog, I knew I wanted something fast, simple, and easy to maintain. I didn't want to deal with databases, server-side runtimes, or bloated CMS platforms. That led me straight to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) — a static site generator built with Go.

Hugo takes Markdown files, runs them through templates, and spits out a fully static website. No servers to manage, no security patches to worry about, and the pages load incredibly fast. You write your content in Markdown, run a build command, and you've got a complete site ready to deploy.

What really sold me is the developer experience. Hugo's local dev server rebuilds the site in milliseconds and refreshes the browser automatically. It makes writing and previewing posts feel effortless.

## The Theme

For the look and feel, I'm using the [github-style](https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style) theme. It's clean, responsive, and gets out of the way so the content can be the focus. It supports featured images, social links, multiple languages, and plenty of customization options — all without being overcomplicated.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

The whole site is hosted on GitHub Pages with automated deployments. Every time I push a change to the main branch, a GitHub Actions workflow kicks in — it builds the site with Hugo and deploys it automatically. No manual steps, no FTP uploads, no hassle. Just write, commit, push, and the site is updated.

## What's Next

I plan to use this space to write about the things I'm working on, things I'm learning, and topics that interest me. If any of that sounds interesting to you, stick around — there's more to come.

Thanks for reading!
