## Hi, I'm Corey Daley

I'm a software engineer who's fascinated by the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. This blog is my corner of the internet where I explore how AI tools are transforming the way we write code, create content, and solve problems.

## What I Do

I build things with code—and increasingly, I build them _with AI_. From web development to automation workflows, I'm constantly experimenting with how different AI assistants can augment human capabilities without replacing human judgment.

My current toolkit includes:

- **Claude Code** for architectural decisions and complex, multi-file changes
- **GitHub Copilot** for code completion and routine tasks in VS Code
- **ChatGPT** for visual content creation and brainstorming
- **GitKraken** for Git workflows and creating AI-powered commit messages
- **Hugo** as my static site generator of choice (you're looking at it!)

## Why This Blog Exists

This site was built collaboratively with Claude Code—not just to have a blog, but to explore _how_ AI and humans work together effectively. Every post is an experiment in AI-assisted creation, and I'm transparent about that process.

I write about:

- **AI-assisted development** and how different tools find their niches
- **Web development** with Hugo, static site generators, and modern tooling
- **Ethics and best practices** around AI in software engineering and open source
- **Productivity workflows** that balance automation with intentionality
- **Career insights** from navigating the rapidly evolving tech landscape

## My Philosophy on AI

I don't believe AI is here to replace developers—I believe it's here to amplify what we can do. But with that power comes responsibility. I think a lot about questions like:

- When does using AI cross the line from productivity tool to ethical problem?
- How do we maintain authenticity and skill development while leveraging AI?
- What does transparency look like when AI contributes to our work?
- How can we use AI as a learning tool rather than a replacement for learning?

You'll find these themes woven throughout my writing, because I believe the best way to navigate AI's role in software engineering is through open, honest exploration of the hard questions.

## The Iterative Approach

One of my core beliefs is that great software emerges from iteration, not perfection on the first try. Whether I'm building a Hugo theme, writing a blog post, or integrating a new AI tool into my workflow, I embrace the cycle of:

1. **Build** something that works
2. **Test** it in the real world
3. **Get feedback** (from humans or from running into problems)
4. **Refine** based on what I learned
5. **Repeat**

This blog itself is a product of that process—constantly evolving as I learn more about what works and what doesn't.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not experimenting with AI tools or writing about software engineering, I'm thinking about how technology shapes our work, our communities, and our future. I'm particularly interested in:

- How AI is changing hiring practices and career development
- The democratization of technical skills through AI assistance
- Building in public and sharing the learning journey
- The ethics of AI-generated content in open source communities

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the intersection of technology and creativity.

- **Email**: [corey@coreydaley.dev](mailto:corey@coreydaley.dev)

## About This Site

This blog is built with:

- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** (v0.155.1 extended) for blazing-fast static site generation
- **coreydaley-dev theme** created collaboratively with Claude Code
- **[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)** for client-side search functionality
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** for hosting with automated deployments via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

The entire site is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/coreydaley/coreydaley.github.io). Feel free to explore the code, borrow ideas, or contribute improvements!

## What's Next?

I'm still figuring out how to best use AI as a peer—someone to bounce architectural ideas off, explore trade-offs with, and think through solutions before diving into implementation. That's the frontier I'm most excited about exploring.

If you're on a similar journey, or if you have thoughts on any of the topics I write about, I'd love to hear from you. This blog is a conversation, not a monologue.

Thanks for being here!
